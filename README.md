# R

Sample code from my temperature variability project with Dr. Amanda Bates
(2020-2021). In this code, I grouped loggers that are close together
to account for spatial autocorrelation in the data. We did this for the 
modeling step. A few maps are also plotted to visually show how the loggers 
were grouped.
